# LoggingFramework

A simple Java logging framework for learning and demonstration purposes.

## Features

- Custom log message class (`LogMessage`) with log level, timestamp, thread name, and message.
- Easily extensible for different log levels and output formats.
- Suitable for small projects or as a base for building more advanced logging systems.
